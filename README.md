# Graphendemonstrator (WORK IN PROGRESS)

## Description
This is a demonstrator for simple graph algorithms made entirely in Godot 4.2 using GDScript. Currently only BFS is supported, but DFS is in development. Other algorithms could be implemented in the future as well.Â

## Build
The latest build for Linux can always be found [here](https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/hSFIm3XhwKR4jMA).
If you wish to build the software yourself, you will need any version of Godot 4.2 like [Godot 4.2.2](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.2.2-stable/). Open the project using Godot and export it to your desired platform. See the [Godot docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html) for further instructions.
