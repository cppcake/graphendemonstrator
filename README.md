# Graphendemonstrator (WORK IN PROGRESS)

## Description
This is a demonstrator for simple graph algorithms made entirely in Godot 4.2 using GDScript. Currently only BFS and DFS are supported, but other algorithms could be implemented in the future as well.

## Build
The latest builds for Linux and Windows can always be found [here](https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/hSFIm3XhwKR4jMA).
If you wish to build the software yourself, you will need any version of Godot 4.2 like [Godot 4.2.2](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.2.2-stable/). Open the project using Godot and export it to your desired platform. See the [Godot docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html) for further instructions.
